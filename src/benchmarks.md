- **call_counter** represents the operations that are performed in a milestone 1 counter state update.
- **call_counter_wasm** represents the operations that are performed in a milestone 2 counter state update.
- **sgx::fs::read:** an SGX call that accesses the sealed enclave storage which is only readable by one specific enclave instance.
- **ecall** general entry point from the host system to an enclave.
- **no_ops_ocall:** an ocall (a call from the enclave to the host) that does nothing in order to see the impact of an ocall itself.
- **invokations/s:** stands for the number of executions per seconds that can be achieved. This does roughly correspond to tx/s.

## Analysis
- RSA decryption is by far the most expensive step in the whole pipeline. This, however, is hard to migitate as long as no more efficient asymmetric encryption exists.
- The effect of sgx::fs::read does only have a small impact.
- wasm invokation's impact is negligible
- If the current RSA de/-encryption process is optimized, >1000 tx/s, is achievable.


## Testsetup
All tests have been performend on an Intel NUC NUC8i3BEH2, Bean Canyon i3-8109U 3.0 GHz.
